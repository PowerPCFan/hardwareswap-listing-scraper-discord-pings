This is not meant to be used by anyone other than myself, so documentation and ease-of-use/QoL features are not included to simplify the codebase.

If you are interested in a similar project, please use my other project [PowerPCFan/hardwareswap-listing-scraper](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/hardwareswap-listing-scraper). It's pretty much the same thing but it has docs and way more features.
