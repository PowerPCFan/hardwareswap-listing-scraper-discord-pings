- test body parsing
- test not_h and not_w filters
- simplify terminal output since this is webhook oriented not "display everything in terminal/push notifs" oriented like the upstream PowerPCFan/hardwareswap-listing-scraper project
- I have to figure out a way to reduce false positives but maybe that's as simple as adding a global blocklist for certain words and then an allowlist/blocklist override if they need to be allowed in certain categories
- Improve debug mode so I can test without pinging real users in production
