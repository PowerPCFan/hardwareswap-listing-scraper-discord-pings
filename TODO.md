- fix logging date format and timezone, and post timezone - maybe use discord timestamps to adjust to user timestamp
- figure out a way to make sure logging webhook queue fully empties even if the app crashes or is terminated, so I can see the last logs and/or crash reason in discord without having to SSH and check tmux terminal history
  - logging to a file is probably more feasible than this
  - also, the discord logs are cool but realistically do i need a webhook sending every log? idk i could probably remove it
- add a delay before sending posts so i can do a check if the post was deleted by automod and if it was, skip sending it to the ping webhooks
- find a way to convert tables like this https://discord.com/channels/1444776915880775803/1444779357531934761/1447832461466800168 to plaintext that's still readable

- fix issue that combined images are regenerated per webhook sent (maybe generate before running print_new_post for each matching category and then pass through the image path as a print_new_post argument)
- figure out why old posts are sometimes being retrieved even if debug mode and therefore retrieve old posts or whatever its called is off
  - Note: possibly band-aid fixed with the recent addition of skipping posts older than 10 minutes
    - maybe the fix isnt necessary? https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/s/SvE7W5i5BE this posted right as the hwsbot comment posted, the bot and my script posted 5 hours late - maybe its a reddit API issue possibly related to the recent changes
  - possibly related to the issue causing the above problem, its just really buggy rn, for example https://discord.com/channels/1444776915880775803/1444779527497711749/1448873848983257291 didnt go to ddr4 and ddr5 channels when it should have, and it posted twice
