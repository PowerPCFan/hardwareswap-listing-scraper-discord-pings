- test body parsing
- test not_h and not_w filters
- simplify terminal output since this is webhook oriented not "display everything in terminal/push notifs" oriented like the upstream PowerPCFan/hardwareswap-listing-scraper project
- I have to figure out a way to reduce false positives but maybe that's as simple as adding a global blocklist for certain words and then an allowlist/blocklist override if they need to be allowed in certain categories
  - related: add regex matching, maybe use a prefix in the h/w fields like `regexp::`
  - related: fix cpu/gpu being parsed as ram speeds, with one of these:
    - regex
    - blocklist/whitelist system
    - not_h / not_w
    - instead of filtering for like "3600" filter for "DDR4-3600", "3600 MHz", "3600MHz", "3600 MT/s", "3600MT/s"
- Improve debug mode so I can test without pinging real users in production
- fix crashing issue where the error was literally just "0"
- figure out a way to make sure logging webhook queue fully empties even if the app crashes or is terminated, so I can see the last logs and/or crash reason in discord without having to SSH and check tmux terminal history
